        A Love Letter To G*59
    </h1>
    <div class="text">

        <p><br>The love I have for the G*59 Record Label is like no other. Never have I found a singular place where all my favorite artists reside.</br>
            <br>The artists of this record label speak words and explore subjects of suicidal ideation and depression, themes not widely expressed in the music industry.</br>
            <br>setting themselves apart from other mainstream artists. This underground label has attracted a massive cult following, gaining more and more popularity as the years have gone on.</br>
            <br>Like so many others, I love music. It has the power to influence how you feel, think, and act. </br>
            <br>Everybody goes through pain in their lives. Some cope by meditating, others by journaling. I like to cope by listening to music</br>
            <br>Being able to listen to these artists have helped me deal with pain and consoled me when I needed it most. </br>
            <br>The first artists of G*59 that I listened to were those of $uicideBoy$. No, I never felt depressed or thoughts of suicide,</br>
            <br>but I suffered from emotional suppression. I bottled up my feelings inside telling no one, and let it eat me from the inside.  
            <br>My one wish is that I discovered this record label sooner. G*59, from the bottom of my heart, THANK YOU for being there for me.</br>
